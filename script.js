        "7": "who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.\n5. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by\nlove, this is an old rule.\n",

He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well\ncontrolled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will\ncertainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky\nmountain.\n",

Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this\nthought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with\nthe weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should\nnever rest.\n41. Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised,\n",
        "34": "without understanding, like a useless log.\n42. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a\nwrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.\n",

        "37": "45. The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the\nworld of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of\nvirtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.\n",
        "38": "46. He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it\nis as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of\nMara, and never see the king of death.\n47. Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is\n",

        "43": "good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.\n54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that\nof) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good\npeople travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.\n",
        "44": "55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these\nsorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.\n56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the\n",

As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will\ngrow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly\nenlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are\nlike rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.\nChapter V. The Fool\n",
        "47": "60. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is\ntired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.\n61. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or\n",

        "49": "much less sons and wealth?\n63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a\nfool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.\n",
        "50": "64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will\nperceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.\n65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise\n",
        "51": "man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste\nof soup.\n66. Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest\nenemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.\n",
        "52": "67. That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the\nreward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.\n68. No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the\n",
        "53": "reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.\n69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks\nit is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.\n",
        "54": "70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the\ntip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle\nof those who have well weighed the law.\n71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);\n",
        "55": "smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.\n72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to\nthe fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.\n",
        "56": "73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the\nBhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!\n74. \"May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this\n",
        "57": "is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be\ndone or is not to be done,\" thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire\nand pride increase.\n75. \"One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads\nto Nirvana;\" if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this,\nhe will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the\nworld.\n",
        "58": "Chapter VI. The Wise Man (Pandita)\n76. If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are\nto be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs,\nfollow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow\nhim.\n",
        "59": "77. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is\nimproper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.\n78. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for\n",
        "60": "friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of\nmen.\n79. He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage\nrejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).\n",
        "61": "80. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the\narrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.\n81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not\n",
        "62": "amidst blame and praise.\n82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene,\nlike a deep, smooth, and still lake.\n",
        "63": "83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle,\nlonging for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people\nnever appear elated or depressed.\n84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man\n",
        "64": "wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he\ndoes not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good,\nwise, and virtuous.\n85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become\nArhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.\n",
        "65": "86. But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow\nthe law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to\novercome.\n87, 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and\n",
        "66": "follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to\na homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where\nthere seemed to be no enjoyment.

        "70": "93. He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment,\nwho has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is\ndifficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.\n94. The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by\n",

        "72": "96. His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has\nobtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man.\n97. The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has\n",
        "73": "cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the\ngreatest of men.\n98. In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land,\nwherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.\n",
